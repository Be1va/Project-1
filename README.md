# Project 1
calm little 8 by 8 gameboard challenge
Welcome to BitBoard Checkers: The Ultimate Battle of Bits!  

Rules are simple:  
1. Move your pieces diagonally, unless you're a king — then you can strut backwards like you own the place.  
2. Jump over your opponent's pieces to capture them. It's like stepping on their dreams… gently.  
3. Reach the far side to crown a king and become the ruler of the board (bowing optional).  
4. Take turns, stay polite, and remember: no cheating, or the computer might judge you silently.  

Goal: Crush your opponent’s pieces and claim glory!  
Warning: Side effects may include excessive bragging and sudden love for bit manipulation.
